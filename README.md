# Hackathon Registration
This is a serverless function (specifically, an azure function) meant to be triggered via HTTP.

It adds a person to your AD organization, adds their information to your Cosmos DB, and then invites them via SendGrid.

This is a work in progress. It served me well in 2 global hackathons, but the code it self needs some maintaining and love.  
For additional support please open an issue in this repository!
